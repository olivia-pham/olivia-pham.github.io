                    <p>
                        I'm a final year Software Engineering student at UTS with a keen interest in front-end development, 
                        web design and cloud technologies. In our digital world I believe in the importance of smart and 
                        intuitive design, and a smooth user experience when developing software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a UTS Women in Engineering Cooperative Scholar, I have previously worked at CUSCAL, ASX, 
                        WooliesX and Nine Technology in intern and part-time roles. 
                        These experiences have given me the opportunity to explore full stack development, DevOps, 
                        Google Cloud Platform, testing, agile development and product delivery. 
                        My experience in agile development teams given me a keen understanding and appreciation for 
                        iterative scrum workflow, collaborative teamwork and continuous improvement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am passionate about mentorship and supporting women in STEM pathways. 
                        I volunteer at my university UTS as a Gender Equity Ambassador to deliver 
                        Engineering and IT programs to primary and high school students and 
                        work as the Partnerships Lead at Real Skills Education, 
                        a non profit organisation aimed at upskilling, exposing and connecting 
                        tertiary students to STEM industries and opportunities.

                        (code quality) of their respositories. Streamlining this service enabled the engineering teams to easily 
                        check the health of their code repositories in order to make updates and improvements.
